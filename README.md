# To-Do List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple yet elegant that keeps a record of your to-do list. It is elegant and works in all conditions. All the errors and warnings were taken care of.


## It is important to also start the database server when running the App
use the following code :
```Bash
npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
